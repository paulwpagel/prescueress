      <h4>RENDEZVOUS</h4>
      <cite>Todd Melicker</cite>
      <p>
        In Todd Melicker's remarkable debut collection, RENDEZVOUS, the reader finds lines that join, converse, and split apart so completely that at times they literally flip, becoming distorted reflections of their own initial utterance. These are poems troubled by adoration and desire, evolution, and the spiraling of the mind immersed in measurement and inquiry. In quick succession we move from the differences between "more sun" and "same sun" to the abundance of the "floodworld/worried" and the strict limitations of "these daily tasks." Melicker writes—of love, of meeting, of the sun's slow revolution, and of return—in ways that keep these poems circling through the reader's mind. "i'm coming aware of the whole, what" he discloses, and "that all parts/ belong."

      <cite>Jonathan Blum</cite>
      <p>
        LAST WORD, a novella, tells the story of Kip Langer, a successful orthognathic surgeon, who is trying to raise three children, including Eric, a bright but socially awkward thirteen-year-old from his first marriage. As Eric gets into more and more trouble at his Conservative Jewish Day School, Kip tries to understand Eric and guide him toward making better choices. The story, set in a Southern suburban community, examines patterns of love, anger, intimacy, inheritance, and disconnection within one modern blended family.

      <h4>Whale in the Woods,</h4>
      <cite>Blueberry Morningsnow</cite>
      <p>
        Inhabited by spirits, shadows, and ghosts harmonizing from the bleak and muddy bottoms of The Lake—the One and Only Lake—Blueberry Elizabeth Morningsnow's debut collection of poems, WHALE IN THE WOODS, is a landscape of wild-hearted voices calling to us through passions so profound only Whitman has ever evoked them. Resolved, at first, to a ruined and dissolving world, these poems expand and reawaken the sounds of a mythmaking chorus. "A lake is born," we learn, "composed entirely of warm human eyes" and "a child / is born with eyes that only see when he closes him / A dark lake writes a poem / about lakes. It's different than / any other poem about lakes." WHALE IN THE WOODS is brazen, sorrowful, ecstatic, and astonished, and Morningsnow a voice like no other in contemporary poetry. Winner of Rescue Press's 2011 Black Box Poetry Prize, selected by Sabrina Orah Mark.

      <h4>Of Embodies,</h4>
      <cite>Philip Sorenson</cite>
      <p>
        Like an army of flowering stones, Philip Sorenson’s OF EMBODIES evolves fixed positions into organic movement and marches straight into your open heart. These poems are the body and the text; the temple and a subject of discovery—their urgency manifesting itself in vanishing memory, actively decomposing letters, and what kind of material might survive you. These poems are interested in evidence, exact specimens, and wild living inquiry. Here there are indications of the inner workings of the earth, upsets, burials, blood, membranes, mouths, and “tongues learning to penetrate a word with the body to lean in and whisper but meaning is a fleeing.” OF EMBODIES was the Editor’s Choice pick for Rescue Press’ 2011 Black Box Poetry Prize.

        Oblique, intelligent, and sad, <em>The Lily Will</em> introduces readers to a voice beautifully 
        sustained through compressed lyrics and long, meticulous sequences. The geography of 
        this book is one of thistles and ice, love flashed with fear, and frail bodies seeking 
        safety in heavy weather.In its warped miniatures (here an eye, there a red leaf, seen 
        distended through iced glass) there is a commitment to smallness, vulnerability marked by 
        precision, and intimations, too, of the eternal:

        This groundbreaking work of research, investigative scientific studies, never-before collected

        the psychological, literal, and linguistic spaces between animals and humans. The archive cites 
        theories of proxemics and zoosemiotics--as well as the infamous psychological studies of Skinner 
        and Harlow--as both precedent and provocation.

      <p>
        Shot through with dark humor, desolate landscapes, and seemingly impossible plot turns, 
        <em>In the Absence of Predators</em> is a striking collection that haunts long after the 
        stories have reached their outlandish conclusions. Here we discover the most captivating 
        of human forms: dreamers, liars, thieves, murderers, and lovers--characters provoked to 
        search, and those abandoned by their own fates and identities. Wilhelm’s narrative crescendos 
        disclose the most terrifying corners of this world; there are wrecks, blizzards, asylums, 
        agents, road trips, and an army of ghosts. <em>In the Absence of Predators</em> is a masterful 
        debut of five cracked and astonishing stories.

        intoxication, joy, wonder, and waiting--fascinates and compels one to 
        heartbreak, desire, and resignation. These poems are silly and strange, 
        adaptive, fiery, and fiercely observant—as well as bent on the notion 
        that one might attend to even the smallest of extraordinary detail.

      <p>
      In Shane McCrae’s astonishing second chapbook, <em>In Canaan</em>, he inhabits the personae 
      of the escaped slave Margaret Garner, who, in the mid-1800s, murdered one of her 
      daughters in order to keep her from returning to slavery. <em>“I couldn’t stop, Hurting her 
      because it hurt,”</em> writes McCrae in the voice of Garner, <em>“Before that night I never had 
      the chance to love, Anyone, she was the first person I loved.”</em> McCrae composes in broken 
      forms and shattered fragments, retelling a harrowing historical story through the imagined 
      first-person point of view of its tortured and terrified heroine.

      <p>
        The brief and stunning debut by fiction writer Madeline McDonnell. In these 
        technically surprising and lyrically astounding stories, the reader meets three 
        haunted, singular, and unsettled protagonists—Wednesday, Mary, and Lucy—who 
        are up to and up against all sorts of horrendous and hilarious trouble. The 
        reader will discover in this trinity a deeply intelligent, comic, and chaotic 
        view of consciousness, pleasure, and shame along with a panic-inducing proposal, 
        cancer-basketball, and a series of passionate car crashes. Perhaps more importantly, 
        the reader will fall for McDonnell’s poetic touch and her absolute attention to the 
        magic of the sentence.

      Andrea Rexilius’ first book, <em>To Be Human Is To Be A Conversation</em>, combines memoir, essay,

        unheard) language of intimates.

        “Our crime is she began to grow in my skin,” writes Rexilius, “A con artist. A mammal. A
